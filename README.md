This repository corresponds to the DeepReaction project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/chimie-paristech-CTM/DeepReaction.git
cd DeepReaction

# Create and activate the environment
conda create -n reaction python=3.10
conda activate reaction

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support
conda install pytorch==2.5.0 torchvision==0.20.0 torchaudio==2.5.0 -c pytorch

# Install PyTorch Geometric
conda install pyg -c pyg

# Install other dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml

# For Jupyter notebook functionality
pip install jupyterlab
```

### Dataset Preparation

Place your reaction dataset in the appropriate location:

```
./Dataset
```

Alternatively, modify the paths in the configuration file or command-line arguments.

## üíª Training

### Using Command Line Interface

To train the model with the dataset using our specialized training script:

```bash
# Basic training with default parameters
./example/train.sh
```

### Using Jupyter Notebook (Interactive)

We provide an interactive Jupyter notebook for easier experimentation and visualization:

```bash
# Start Jupyter notebook server
jupyter lab

# Navigate to example/train_demo.ipynb
```

The notebook `example/train_demo.ipynb` offers a streamlined interface for:
- Loading and exploring the reaction dataset
- Configuring model architecture and training parameters
- Training with real-time visualization of progress
- Evaluating model performance with interactive visualizations

This is particularly useful for quick experimentation and educational purposes, allowing you to:
- Modify hyperparameters and immediately see their effects
- Visualize the training process and results in real-time
- Interact with model predictions and understand performance characteristics

### Available command line options

- `--readout`: Readout function type (set_transformer, sum, mean, max, attention)
- `--batch`: Batch size for training
- `--epochs`: Maximum number of training epochs
- `--lr`: Learning rate
- `--node-dim`: Dimension of node latent representations
- `--output`: Output directory for results
- `--reaction-root`: Custom path to reaction dataset root, i.e., the location of the xyz files of reactants, products and TSs
- `--reaction-csv`: Custom path to reaction dataset CSV

## üìà Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
# Basic evaluation
./example/inference.sh
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models

```bash
# Fine-tune a pre-trained model on new data
./example/finetune.sh 
```

### Hyperparameter Optimization

```bash
# Run hyperparameter optimization (grid_search)
./example/hyperopt.sh 
```
