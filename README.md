### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/chimie-paristech-CTM/DeepReaction.git
cd DeepReaction

# Create the conda environment from the environment.yml file
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate reaction

# (Optional) For Jupyter notebook support
pip install jupyterlab
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The version of **PyTorch Geometric (PyG)** and its related packages must be selected according to your hardware configuration (e.g., CUDA version).
> Visit the official [PyG installation guide](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) to find the correct command for your system.
> If needed, you can manually install PyG with:

### Dataset Preparation

Place your reaction dataset in the appropriate location:

```
./Dataset
```

Alternatively, modify the paths in the configuration file or command-line arguments.

## üíª Training

### Using Command Line Interface

To train the model with the dataset using our specialized training script:

```
# Basic training with default parameters
./example/train_reaction.py
```

### Using Jupyter Notebook (Interactive)

We provide an interactive Jupyter notebook for easier experimentation and visualization:

```bash
# Start Jupyter notebook server
jupyter lab

# Navigate to example/train_reaction.ipynb
```

The notebook `example/train_reaction.ipynb` offers a streamlined interface for:
- Loading and exploring the reaction dataset
- Configuring model architecture and training parameters
- Training with real-time visualization of progress
- Evaluating model performance with interactive visualizations

This is particularly useful for quick experimentation and educational purposes, allowing you to:
- Modify hyperparameters and immediately see their effects
- Visualize the training process and results in real-time
- Interact with model predictions and understand performance characteristics

### Available command line options

- `--readout`: Readout function type (set_transformer, sum, mean, max, attention)
- `--batch`: Batch size for training
- `--epochs`: Maximum number of training epochs
- `--lr`: Learning rate
- `--node-dim`: Dimension of node latent representations
- `--output`: Output directory for results
- `--reaction-root`: Custom path to reaction dataset root, i.e., the location of the xyz files of reactants, products and TSs
- `--reaction-csv`: Custom path to reaction dataset CSV

## üìà Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model:

```
# Basic evaluation
./example/predict_reaction.ipynb
```

## üîß Advanced Usage


### Hyperparameter Optimization

```bash
# Run hyperparameter optimization
./example/hyperopt_grid.py
```
